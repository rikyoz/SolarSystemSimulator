**Solar System Simulator** is a WebGL program which allows users to view a detailed enough simulation of our solar system, showing the current (within certain limits of approximation) position of the major and dwarf planets, as well as the Earth's Moon, the famous Hubble telescope and the recently launched Tesla by SpaceX.

## Textures

Almost all the textures were taken from https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/ with the following exceptions:
+ The Moon normal map was taken from https://bit.ly/2r1kJb2, while bump map from https://bit.ly/2HuPwHo.
+ Mars's normal map was taken from https://bit.ly/2HUWHrQ, while bump map from https://imgur.com/HIQ7R.
+ Updated (with Juno mission data) textures for Jupiter were taken from https://bit.ly/2HtFfeK.
+ Uranus's rings texture was taken from https://bit.ly/2r1II9Y.
